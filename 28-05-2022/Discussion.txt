What is Java?
	Programming language
	Platform -> JRE -> JVM
	Secure and Object oriented programming language.

How java program will be run?

Location to find the compiler and the interpreter :-  JAVA_HOME -> C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_172\bin
1. Compilation
		-> Syntax :- javac <ProgramName.java>
		-> Example:- javac WelcomeToJava.java
	The above command generates .class file ex:- WelcomeToJava.class
	This file contains code which is understandable by system -> ByteCode

2. Interpretation
	-> Syntax :- java ProgramName
	-> Syntax :- java WelcomeToJava
	

Features of Java
	1. Simple
	2. Object Oriented
			Class
				-> contains methods and variables
						Fields -> Variables -> Instance/Static
						Methods -> main, withdraw, deposit, checkBalance
						Constructors -> Used to initialize the object
						Blocks -> Instance/Static
						Nested class and/or interfaces.	
						Syntax :-
							class Employee{
								fields
								methods...
							}
			Object
				-> State -> Data/Value of the object
				-> Behavior -> functionality of the object
				-> Identity -> unique id,  used by JVM to identify each object uniquely
				Definitions
					-> Instance of a class
					-> real world entity
					-> entity which has state and behavior.
					Syntax :-
						Employee daniel = new Employee("Daniel", "Mervy");
			Encapsulation
			Inheritance
			Abstraction
				Abstract Class
				Interfaces
			Polymorphism		
	3. Portable  
	4. Platform Independent
	5. Secured
	6. Robust
	7. Multithreaded
	
	
private 
	-> the members are only accessible inside the class
public 
	-> anyone from anywhere can access the members of the class
protected
	-> only members from current package and from other packages having parent child relationship 
default
	-> only members from current package
	

Data-types
		1 Byte = 8 Bits
		Primitive
			-> DATATYPE -> SIZE -> DEFAULT_VALUE
			->  boolean -> 1 bit 	-> false
			-> char	-> 2 bytes 	-> '\u0000'
			Number/Integer
			-> byte	-> 1 byte 		-> 0
			-> short	-> 2 bytes 	-> 0
			-> int		-> 4 bytes 	-> 0
			-> long	-> 8 bytes 	-> 0
			Number/Decimals
			-> float	-> 4 bytes 	-> 0.0f
			-> double -> 8 bytes 	-> 0.0d

		Non Primitive
			->  Classes, Interfaces, and Arrays.			
		Because of the presence of primitive types in java, Java is not a completely OOP Language
		
		Tackle -> Wrapper Classes -> 
				boolean -> Boolean Class	
				char -> Character Class	
				byte -> Byte Class	
				short -> Short Class	
				int -> Integer Class	
				long-> Long Class	
				float-> Float Class	
				double-> Double Class
